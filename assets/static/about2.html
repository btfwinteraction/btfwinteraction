                        Breaking the fourth wall interaction design webpage is a research project of Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab ( <a href="https://idvxlab.com/" target="_blank">idvxlab.com</a> ) of Tongji University, aiming to summarize the patterns of breaking the fourth wall interaction design in data stories and form the design space of BTFW interaction design (see home page). We organized user study on BTFW interaction design in data stories in 2022 to evaluate the effectiveness of the design space. The results of our user study suggested that BTFW interaction has a positive impact on self-story connection, user engagement, and information recall. Concerns about the interactivity-comprehensibility balance, information privacy, and the learning curve of the interaction are also raised when using BTFW interactions.

                        The design space of breaking the fourth wall of interaction design on the home page of the website includes a total of 58 data story cards, each card corresponds to a data story, coded according to "design mode", "input" and "output". To help you better understand and use the interaction, we provide details of the BTFW interactive application on the back of the card, including the story's topic, input content, input method, output, etc. Note that some of the stories correspond to multiple interaction design patterns, which we color-coded using gradients.

                        Since the research results of the design space are based on the analysis of interaction design in data stories, we provide a list of 58 high-quality data stories as research samples on the download page, which are derived from academic research related to the visualization field or widely recognized by the visualization field, and these data stories provide us with great help in building the design space. We also provide instructional cards for using the design space on the download page, which we hope will help you understand BTFW interaction design in more depth.
